Data last refreshed: 4/20/23

### Purpose
To track how many people have joined the Purdue Hackers Discord Community since we migrated from Slack -> Discord 🕺

### Process
- Added carl-bot to track join-leave logs a week after the server was created
- Exported channel to a .txt file using [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)
  - Unsure if I should upload the .txt file :x will probably upload later
- Create and run the Jupyter Notebook 🏃‍♂️
- Share fun graphs :y

### Future Plans
- Make graphs interactive
- Discord Bot? 🤖
- Tidy up some code and explanations

### Highlights
- Aug-22: 297 new members (biggest growth)
- 82 new members in one day 👁 ([Fall 2022 Callout!!!!](https://events.purduehackers.com/fall-2022-callout))
